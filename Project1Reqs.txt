Project 1:
Likely due March 9th

All
You may use Java's collections implementations
Must implement all CRUD (create-read-update-delete) functionality for database
Must include some form(s) of multiplicity

Option 1
Must be a REST api that employs a front-controller/MVC architecture
Must employ an ORM (hibernate, spring orm) instead of JDBC
Because this option is basically simpler, you would be required to make
    some more complicated queries using either HQL or criteria API

OR

Option 2 (harder)
You may use servlets to implement a front-end (you will have to learn html on your own)
While using Hibernate

Debating:
Must be deployed on an azure VM (depending on how fast I can get to this)
