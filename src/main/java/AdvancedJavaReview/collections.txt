list -
sequentially ordered list of items, iterable, maintain their order, can contain nulls/duplicates
arraylist/linkedlist
set -
only unique values
treeset/hashset
(treeset is ordered and can be iterated through and is log(n) insert/get,
hashset cannot be ordered and is o(1) for insert/get)
map -
unique keys paired with their values
(hashmap, treemap)
HashMap<Integer, String> myHashMap = new HashMap<Integer, String>;

hashtable vs hashmap?
hashmap allows for a single null key/null values and hashtable does not
hashtable is thread safe
stringbuffer is threadsafe (over stringbuilder)
vector is threadsafe (over arraylist)

queue -
fifo add to end
stack -
lifo 'push' and 'pop'
