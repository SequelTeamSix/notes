REST
Stands for Representational State Transfer.
Defined originally by Roy Fielding in his dissertation in 2000, REST is an architectural style that outlines communication between a client and server over the web.
Essentially for a web service to be RESTful it has to adhere to a set of guidelines or constraints.
A RESTful server should not retain information about the state of the client.
Clients communicate with the server through an interface that is standard in that it too follows another set of constraints:
"defined by four interface constraints: identification of resources; manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive messages; and, hypermedia as the engine of application state." - Roy Fielding
In a RESTful system, the server creates an object or resource and returns the state of that object (the values contained within the object) when requested by the client.
