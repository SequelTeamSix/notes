Bubbling and capturing:
event propagation - when an event fires in js, it is activated on its element, but also propagates to others
bubbling - the event recursively propagates to parent elements
capturing - the event recursively propagates to child elements

target.addEventListener(type, listener, true)
button.addEventListener(onclick, callback, true)
send the onclick event to all children of button
