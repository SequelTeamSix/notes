        if we want to perform a CRUD operation,
        we often have multiple ways to do this
        (I suppose using native SQL is an option, but this defeats the purpose of using hibernate)

        CREATE:
        save(object) - immediately inserts an object to the database
        persist(object) - inserts the object at the end of transaction

        UPDATE:
        merge() - used to send back into persistence an object which we've already detached
        (detached review - detached means that either the object has been .evict() or the session it belonged
        to has closed)
        if merge used with transient object, it will persist it
        update()
        may only be used on a persisted or detached object

        READ:
        load()
        returns a proxy (reference) of an object from persistence
        if no matches in database: return null
        get()
        immediately returns a mapped object
        if no matches: throw an error

        DELETE:
        delete() a persisted object

        /*lazy vs eager fetching:
        lazy: entries received from joins are fetched from the database only when they are requested
        eager: entries received from joins are fetched together with the object
        it's a performance thing

        two issues with this:
        1: what if we try to lazily fetch from a detached object?
        lazy initialization error: in order to lazily fetch, our objects should be persisted

        BUT:
        2: what if we have both objects in a join eagerly fetched,
        wouldn't they just fall into a loop of fetching each other?
        in the case of creating json/string representations of the objects, yes!
        so, if you get a stackoverflow error with hibernate, this is likely why
