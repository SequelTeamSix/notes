(Work on these if you don't have an idea of what else to do)

Data Structures/Algorithms you will most likely need to know:

Data Structures - algorithmic ways to store data
Algorithms - process for doing operations that solves a particular goal

DS:
(you should know things like insertion at beginning/end, deletion, searches,
traversal of all elements when applicable)
Binary Tree (including traversal)
Linked List
Array List
All types of queue (queue, stack, arraydeque)
Hash table (set/map)

Algorithms:
You should know:
The basic sorts (Bubble, Selection, Insertion)
Merge Sort
Linear search
Binary search
Depth-first search
Breadth-first search

At the end I'd like to mention some other algorithms like Dijkstra's/graph search
