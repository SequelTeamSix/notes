(Work on these if you don't have an idea of what else to do)

Data Structures/Algorithms you will most likely need to know:

Data Structures - algorithmic ways to store data
Algorithms - process for doing operations that solves a particular goal

DS:
(you should know things like insertion at beginning/end, deletion, searches,
traversal of all elements when applicable)
Binary Tree (including traversal) (*)
Linked List (*)
Array List (*)
All types of queue (queue, stack, arraydeque)
Hash table (set/map)

Algorithms:
You should know:
The basic sorts (Bubble, Selection, Insertion) (*)
Merge Sort
Linear search (*)
Binary search (*)
Depth-first search (means that we navigate to a path as far as possible until we are
forced back, binary tree search) (*)
Breadth-first search

At the end I'd like to mention some other algorithms like Dijkstra's/graph search

My recommendation for studying algorithms:
take the implementations and add in print statements to see the state that the execution
is in at any moment
As well as reading about them online
